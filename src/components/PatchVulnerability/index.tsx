              Today, most IT departments are stretched thin and keeping up with
              patches and vulnerabilities has become a full-time job.
              Adversaries utilizing attack vectors frequently seek to exploit
              vulnerabilities on systems that have not yet been patched against
              publicly available exploits. This leaves your organization at risk
              for a costly attack that could shut down business for good.
